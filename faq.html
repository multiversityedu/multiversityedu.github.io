                    <div class="faq-question">
                        <h3>What makes Multiversity different from other online course platforms?</h3>
                        <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2.5" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M19.5 8.25l-7.5 7.5-7.5-7.5" /></svg>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Unlike platforms that treat educators as mere content creators, Multiversity is a partnership. We empower educators to build their own independent "Academies" with full control over content and pricing. For students, this means a structured, high-quality learning experience directly from the experts, free from the distractions of fragmented tools or ad-driven models.</p>

                <!-- Question 2 -->
                <div class="faq-item animate-on-scroll slide-up-on-scroll" style="transition-delay: 100ms;">
                    <div class="faq-question">
                        <h3>How do educators earn money? Is there a monthly subscription fee?</h3>
                        <p>There are **no monthly subscription fees** for educators. Our model is a simple, transparent commission on sales. For our standard "Partner Tier", we take a 10% commission on every course sale you make. The "Pro Partner Tier" offers advanced features for a lower 5% commission. This means we only make money when you do, aligning our success directly with yours.</p>

                <!-- Question 3 -->
                <div class="faq-item animate-on-scroll slide-up-on-scroll" style="transition-delay: 200ms;">
                    <div class="faq-question">
                        <h3>How does pricing work for students?</h3>
                        <p>Students pay on a per-course basis, directly determined by the educator. You are not subscribing to the Multiversity platform. For "Live Cohorts", this is typically a monthly tuition fee for the duration of the course. For "Self-Paced" courses, it's usually a one-time payment for lifetime access. All pricing is clearly displayed on the course page.</p>

                <!-- Question 4 -->
                <div class="faq-item animate-on-scroll slide-up-on-scroll" style="transition-delay: 300ms;">
                    <div class="faq-question">
                        <h3>What's the difference between a Live Cohort and a Self-Paced course?</h3>
                        <p>A **Live Cohort** is a scheduled, interactive class with a fixed start and end date, much like a traditional classroom. It features live video sessions, real-time interaction with the teacher and peers, and a structured timeline. A **Self-Paced** course consists of pre-recorded video lectures and materials that you can access anytime and complete at your own speed.</p>

                <!-- Question 5 -->
                <div class="faq-item animate-on-scroll slide-up-on-scroll" style="transition-delay: 400ms;">
                    <div class="faq-question">
                        <h3>Do I have control over my course content as an educator?</h3>
                        <p>Absolutely. You have 100% autonomy. You own your content, structure your curriculum, set your own prices (above a small platform minimum to ensure quality), and manage your student community. We provide the tools; you provide the vision and expertise.</p>

                <!-- Question 6 -->
                <div class="faq-item animate-on-scroll slide-up-on-scroll" style="transition-delay: 500ms;">

                        <h3>What is the AI-Powered Doubt Resolution feature?</h3>
                        <p>For participating courses, our integrated AI (powered by models like LLaMA 3) can provide instant answers to student questions. The AI analyzes transcripts of class lectures and course materials to give contextually accurate responses 24/7. Any questions the AI cannot resolve are automatically forwarded to the educator's "doubt bank" for a personal reply.</p>

                <!-- Question 7 -->
                <div class="faq-item animate-on-scroll slide-up-on-scroll" style="transition-delay: 600ms;">
                    <div class="faq-question">
                        <h3>Is there a way to interact with other students and the teacher?</h3>
                        <p>Yes. Every course and cohort comes with its own dedicated community forum. This is a private space for you to ask questions, discuss topics, share your work, and collaborate with your peers and the educator, fostering a true sense of a digital classroom.</p>

                <div class="faq-item animate-on-scroll slide-up-on-scroll" style="transition-delay: 700ms;">
                    <div class="faq-question">
                        <h3>Do I need to be technically skilled to set up my academy?</h3>
                        <p>Not at all. We've designed the platform to be as intuitive as possible. If you can use social media or send an email, you can create a course on Multiversity. We handle all the complex technical aspects like video hosting, payment processing, and server maintenance so you can focus on what you do best: teaching.</p>
